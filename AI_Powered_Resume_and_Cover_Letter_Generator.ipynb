        "1.✅Handling API Failures\n",
        "Challenge: Invalid API keys or model names caused the app to crash.\n",
        "\n",
        "Solution:\n",
        "Added try-except blocks to catch API errors and display them in the UI instead of crashing. The code was updated to use a stable model name (gemini-1.5-flash-latest) to ensure reliability.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2.✅Simplifying User Input\n",
        "Challenge: The interface for adding a resume (upload vs. paste) was cluttered.\n",
        "\n",
        "Solution:\n",
        "Used a Gradio radio button to dynamically show only the relevant input field (either the file uploader or the text area), creating a cleaner user experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3.✅Clean File Downloads\n",
        "Challenge: Offering both PDF and TXT downloads resulted in large, confusing UI buttons.\n",
        "\n",
        "Solution:\n",
        "\n",
        "Switched to a single gr.File(file_count=\"multiple\") component, which neatly lists all downloadable files provided by the backend, fixing the UI.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4.✅Parsing Inconsistent PDF Resume Formats\n",
        "Challenge: Resumes uploaded as PDFs have varied layouts (e.g., multi-column, tables). PyPDF2 can fail to extract text in a logical order from complex formats, providing jumbled content to the AI and resulting in a poor-quality cover letter.\n",
        "\n",
        "Solution:\n",
        "\n",
        "The primary solution was to offer a \"Paste Text\" option as a reliable alternative. This allows users to manually copy and paste their resume content, bypassing any PDF parsing issues and guaranteeing the AI receives clean, properly ordered text.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.✅Translating AI Formatting to PDF Output\n",
        "Challenge: The Gemini model often generates text with markdown for formatting (like **Headings** or * Bullet points), but the fpdf2 library doesn't understand markdown and would just print it as plain text.\n",
        "\n",
        "Solution:\n",
        "\n",
        "A simple post-processing function was created to parse the AI's text output. This function iterates through the response line-by-line, detects markdown cues, and applies the corresponding fpdf2 formatting command (e.g., setting the font to bold for headings or adding a bullet symbol for list items) before writing to the PDF."
